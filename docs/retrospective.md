## What went well
This project has been a success. The ultimate creation of the website can be considered a major success. Before creating the website, the exact design of the website was vague, but as time went on, the design of the website became clearer. Links within the website and in the documentation are working, which is another success. 

## What went wrong 
One thing that went wrong was trying to create the second webpage in a different way than it is now. At first, the second webpage was going to have pictures on the same row as the paragraphs that correlate to it. However, that idea became more complicated than previously thought, so the way the website is now became the best option. Trying to make the first webpage look good on mobile devices took hours to learn as well; however, it worked, but a lot had to go wrong for it to work.

## What could have been done diffferently
When it comes to the idea of “what could have been done differently”, if more time were available, creating the second webpage in a way that I had previously envisioned is an option. Adding buttons and some more boxes around words could have been used to enhance the website’s visual appeal.
